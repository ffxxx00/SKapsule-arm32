# SKapsule

An unofficial Android (arm64) port of **Spiral Knights**.

SKapsule runs the _real_ Spiral Knights desktop client on your phone or tablet. It
ships a custom JRE and a set of native libraries, then boots the game's own Java VM
on-device — the game code and assets are downloaded and patched from the official
servers at runtime (via getdown), exactly like the desktop client. Nothing about the
game itself is bundled in this repository.

> **Status: experimental / alpha.** The game boots, logs in, and is playable, but
> there are known rough edges (see [Known issues](#known-issues)). Expect bugs.

## Disclaimer

Spiral Knights is © SEGA / Grey Havens, LLC. **This is an unofficial, fan-made port
and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by SEGA or Grey Havens.**

- No Spiral Knights game code or art assets are included in this repository or in the
  APK. They are downloaded from the official servers at first launch, the same way the
  official desktop launcher works.
- You need your own Spiral Knights account (web or Steam) to play.
- This project exists to let people play a game they already own on hardware the
  official client doesn't target. Please support the game through official channels.

## Controls

Gameplay is **gamepad-first**. Touch controls are in place; they are newer than the gamepad
path and still getting fine-tuning. Every finger is routed to the control it lands on, so
buttons work while a joystick is held (fixed after
[#43](https://github.com/SKonstruct/SKapsule/issues/43) — before that, holding the move
stick made every button unpressable).

- **Gamepad or Touch** — primary input for gameplay (movement, combat, menus).
- **Keyboard** — used as needed for text entry (login, chat). An on-screen
  **Keyboard** button is provided for devices without a physical keyboard.

## Installing (players)

1. Grab the latest signed `skapsule-vX.X.X.apk` from the
   [Releases](../../releases) page.
2. Copy it to your arm64 Android device (Android 8.0 / API 26 or newer) and install,
   allowing installation from unknown sources if prompted.
3. Launch **SKapsule**. On first run it unpacks the bundled JRE and runtime, then
   downloads/patches the game from the official servers — this first launch takes a
   while and needs a network connection.
4. Choose **Play (Web)** or **Play (Steam)** and sign in with your own account.

Later releases install themselves: when a newer version is published the launcher shows an
**Update available** banner, and tapping it downloads the APK and hands it to the system
installer (grant "install unknown apps" once when prompted). The dialog also offers release
notes and a **Skip this version** option.

Upstream releases support only `arm64-v8a` devices.

This fork also includes an experimental `armeabi-v7a` build for Android systems
that run apps in 32-bit mode, including on a 64-bit CPU. Device gameplay testing
is still required; ARM32 support is not yet verified on a Galaxy A13. The ARM32
build uses a matched FCL Java 25.0.3 runtime, a 512 MB default heap (1 GB maximum),
and disables the upstream ARM64-only APK updater.

The ARM32 build replaces FCL's mismatched AArch64 AWT placeholder with a locally
built JNI stub linked to the ARM32 headless AWT library. It omits the AArch64
`jspawnhelper` from the common image and uses Java's `FORK` process mechanism.
It caps multi-release JAR selection at Java 17 with `jdk.util.jar.version=17`,
so LWJGL uses its JNI bindings rather than the Java 25 FFM linker unsupported
by this ARM32 runtime. Java itself remains version 25.

For an interpreter-only diagnostic APK, add `-PskJvmInterpreted=true` to the
ARM32 Gradle build. This disables Java JIT for that build and can be much slower;
normal builds keep JIT enabled. Stalled startup logs also include native thread
snapshots and the stage reached by the HotSpot thread-dump collector.
Experimental 6 combines this interpreter mode with the JNI layer selection above:
experimental 5 stalled with JIT enabled before producing a game frame, while the
earlier interpreter trial reached an exception in LWJGL's FFM layer. Full game
startup with the combined workaround still needs device testing.

To build ARM32, run the native build scripts with `ABIS=armeabi-v7a` and
`LWJGL_BUILD_ARCH=arm32`, then run `scripts/stage-launcher-assets.sh` with
`LWJGL_BUILD_ARCH=arm32` and `bash scripts/stage-arm32-jre.sh`. Assemble with
`./gradlew -PskAbi=armeabi-v7a :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest` from
`launcher/`. The default build remains ARM64. CI builds each ABI separately;
the ARM32 APK is a workflow artifact, not an upstream release asset.

The first experimental Windows build uses the ARM32 native bundle from
[FCL commit 7de9a77](https://github.com/FCL-Team/FoldCraftLauncher/tree/7de9a7742ea384dd0998ec004da41361ae6596f8),
with LWJGL Java modules compiled from this repository's pinned submodule.
Its 1,891 core and 2,236 Android OpenGL JNI exports match the source bindings.
gl4es, OpenAL, caciocavallo, frenchpress and the launcher are built from source.
CI uses the existing LWJGL native build script instead of that prebuilt bundle.

## Building from source (developers)

The APK is a _full from-source_ build: every native component is compiled from its
submodule, staged into the launcher, and then the Android app is assembled. CI does
exactly this — see [`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`](.github/workflows/build-apk.yml)
for the canonical, reproducible recipe.

### Prerequisites

| Tool            | Version                 | Used for                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android SDK     | compileSdk/targetSdk 35 | building the app                                                            |
| Android NDK     | `30.0.14904198`         | native libs (Clang 20; NDK 27's Clang 18 miscompiles OpenAL's C++20 ranges) |
| CMake           | `3.22.1`                | native build                                                                |
| JDK 8           |                         | LWJGL's Java-8 multi-release layer                                          |
| JDK 25          |                         | caciocavallo + frenchpress (`--release 25`)                                 |
| ant, ninja, zip |                         | submodule build scripts                                                     |

Set `ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_NDK_HOME` appropriately.

### 1. Clone with submodules

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SKonstruct/SKapsule.git
cd SKapsule
```

### 2. Build the native components

These compile each submodule for `arm64-v8a` and drop outputs into `out/`:

```bash
./scripts/build-gl4es-android.sh
./scripts/build-openal-android.sh
./scripts/build-lwjgl3-android.sh        # JAVA_HOME -> JDK 25 (matches dev box), JAVA8_HOME -> JDK 8
./scripts/build-cacio-android.sh         # CACIO_JAVA_HOME -> JDK 25
./scripts/build-frenchpress-android.sh   # FRENCHPRESS_JAVA_HOME -> JDK 25
```

### 3. Stage assets into the launcher

```bash
./scripts/stage-launcher-assets.sh
```

### 4. Assemble the APK

```bash
cd launcher
JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-25 ./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

The output lands in `launcher/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. Without signing
configured (below) this is `skapsule-vX.X.X-unsigned.apk`.

### Signing (optional)

Release signing reads, in order, a gitignored `launcher/keystore.properties` then
environment variables. With neither present, `assembleRelease` still succeeds and
emits an _unsigned_ APK. Provide `storeFile`/`storePassword`/`keyAlias`/`keyPassword`
(props) or `SK_KEYSTORE_FILE`/`SK_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`/`SK_KEY_ALIAS`/`SK_KEY_PASSWORD`
(env) to produce a signed `skapsule-vX.X.X.apk`. See `keystore.properties.template`.

In CI, the keystore is supplied via the `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`,
`KEY_ALIAS`, and `KEY_PASSWORD` repo secrets. A push of a `v*` tag with signing
secrets present publishes a GitHub Release with the signed APK attached.

## How it works

```
LauncherActivity ─ unpacks JRE + runtime, picks Web/Steam, launches GameActivity
        │
GameActivity (:game process) ─ starts the FCL JVM, sets up EGL/GLES + input
        │
native (sklauncher.c) ─ boots the JVM, calls into the bootstrap
        │
SkBootstrap ─ runs HeadlessGetdown (validates/patches the game), then invokes
              com.threerings.projectx.client.ProjectXApp in-process
```

The game is a standard desktop Java client, so the port supplies everything that
client expects on a platform Android lacks:

| Component        | What it provides                                          | Source                                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JRE 25**       | the Java runtime the game runs on                         | bundled asset                                                              |
| **gl4es**        | translates the game's OpenGL calls to OpenGL ES           | [`gl4es`](https://github.com/SKonstruct/gl4es) submodule                   |
| **openal-soft**  | audio                                                     | [`openal-soft`](https://github.com/SKonstruct/openal-soft) submodule       |
| **LWJGL 3.4.1**  | windowing / GL / input bindings (Android-native build)    | [`lwjgl3`](https://github.com/SKonstruct/lwjgl3) submodule                 |
| **caciocavallo** | headless AWT bridge (the game uses AWT/Swing for some UI) | [`caciocavallo17`](https://github.com/SKonstruct/caciocavallo17) submodule |
| **frenchpress**  | Steam login (SteamKit-style auth)                         | [`frenchpress`](https://github.com/SKonstruct/frenchpress) submodule       |
| **getdown**      | downloads, verifies, and patches the game                 | bundled `getdown-pro.jar`                                                  |

A small `bootstrap` Java module (`SkBootstrap`, `HeadlessGetdown`) and the launcher's
Kotlin installers wire these together.

## Game Mode

The app declares itself a game (`android:appCategory="game"`), so Android 12+ treats it as
one: the Game Dashboard appears and the system applies its game optimisations.

`res/xml/game_mode_config.xml` opts out of one of them. The platform's downscaling
intervention resizes the backbuffer without telling the app, and Spiral Knights lays its
own UI out in raw framebuffer pixels: below roughly 578 px of surface height the client's
UI stops laying out and character select never appears. The resolution slider already
offers that trade-off, with a floor we know is safe. FPS override stays enabled.

## Editing the touch controls

**Edit Controls** in the options sidebar opens the same editor the ⚙ button opens in game —
drag to reposition, per-control visibility and scale, opacity, resolution, and Reset — without
booting the game first. It opens landscape because the layout is stored relative to the
landscape play area, so what you arrange is what you get.

If the game is still running in the background it keeps its own copy of the layout and will
overwrite whatever you change here when it closes, so exit the game first.

In game, a row of buttons sits top-left: **ESC, Settings, Keyboard, Eye**. The eye is a
shortcut for **Show Buttons**, which is off by default and hides every button except ESC,
leaving the joysticks and this row. **Show Controls** turns the touch controls off entirely,
taking the keyboard and eye buttons with them; Settings stays so the editor is still
reachable. All four can be dragged while the editor is open.

## News card

The home screen shows the current in-game announcement — the same feed the desktop
[KnightLauncher](https://github.com/lucasluqui/KnightLauncher) renders, so both show the
same thing at the same time. Tapping the card opens the announcement thread. If there is
nothing running, or the service is unreachable, the card simply is not shown.

Two things about the feed are normal, not bugs: it rotates, so consecutive launches can show
different announcements, and most entries carry no expiry — those show no countdown.

## Crash reporting

Uncaught exceptions and a few detected failures (runtime unpack, mod download/apply/remove,
a failed self-update) are reported to Sentry, with the device model, Android version, app
build, which process it came from, and the same logcat dump that **Share Logs** exports.
Credentials, tokens and account emails are stripped. Native crashes are not captured: the
SDK's NDK component installs signal handlers, and the bundled JVM in this process needs
those signals for itself.

On by default; **Send crash reports** in the options sidebar turns it off, and the change
takes effect immediately.

## Known issues

- **Character-shadow shader artifact.** Character shadows can render as a filled
  quad. The shader _link_ bug is fixed, but a visual artifact persists from another
  cause. Workaround: set graphics quality to **Low**.
- **Experimental maturity.** Lifecycle/resume, input, and login paths work but
  haven't been hardened across the full range of devices and Android versions.
- **APK size.** The bundled runtime makes for a large (~90 MB) APK; it is untuned.
